/*You can put your CSS, images, JavaScript and other static files inside /static.
This directory is known to Flask as the static directory and files inside can be referenced directly.

For example a file css/styles.css can be referenced
/static/css/styles.css

The static file directory can also be referenced inside your templates with a function
{{ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css') }}
{{ url_for('static', filename='img/dog.jpg') }}
*/
